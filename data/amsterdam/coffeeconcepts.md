Large worktable and counter seats suitable for working. Very fast WiFi but no power outlets at the seats. I stayed for an hour on a weekday morning, which was fine. I asked if it was ok to use laptops and they said as long as I don't stay "too long". The staff was quite pushy asking if I wanted to order more drinks, so I figured an hour was probably the limit - a bit weird since there was no one else in there. The bathroom door had no lock at the time of visiting (in July of 2023). Hopefully that's fixed by now!
