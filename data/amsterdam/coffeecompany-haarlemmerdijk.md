After struggling to find "laptop friendly" cafes in the Netherlands, I've learned that "coffeecompany" is usually a safe choice. There are many locations throughout the Netherlands, they have fast wifi, power outlets, and they're laptop friendly. You'll want to arrive early though, to make sure you get a (good) seat. Tip: the large worktable has power outlets under the table.
