More of a restaurant than a cafe, but it is workable with a large worktable with many people working on their laptops. I wouldn't say it's the best environment though, it's very noisy and busy. Also, the staff didn't seem too happy with the "workers" and were very pushy asking about ordering more food and drinks. I eventually did order some food, but they forgot about my order. No power outlets at the big workable, and the WiFi is very slow. If you just need a drink or a working lunch then it might be fine, but I'd probably choose something else over this place.
