A large modern cafe with lots of seating space. The first area is open and airy, with lots of natural light. Further inside there are individual tables and two large worktables as well. The location might not be the most convenient, but good WiFi and lots of power outlets makes this a great spot to work from. However, the chairs aren't the most comfortable and it got a little noisy in the afternoon. Many types of coffee and good tea selection. The sandwiches are worth trying, but the portion was perhaps slightly too small. Great service and friendly staff.
