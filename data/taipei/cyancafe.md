A small and quaint cafe near Taipei City Hall. Both the interior and exterior are filled with green plants. The interior feels both modern and a little rustic, giving it quite a nice vibe. Luckily I had the entire cafe to myself on a (very) rainy weekday. Perhaps I was the only one that wanted to go out in the rain to find a cafe that day? The menu is quite large, with plenty of drink options, and although I didn't try any, the food sounded very nice (sweet and savory options available). Good WiFi, but slightly lacking power outlets (there was a power strip by the cupboards in the front seating area though).
