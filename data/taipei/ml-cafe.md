A popular lunch/brunch cafe near Dongmen station. During midday it can be a little busy/noisy. However, the afternoon was definitely quieter and made for a comfortable space to work from. The menu is large, with many food and drink options. There's WiFi, but it was very unstable during my visit. Also note that there is a 2 hour time limit during weekends.
