A great cafe near Kunyang MRT, just a short 10 minute walk from the station. Although this at first might feel more like a restaurant it is definitely very workable on a weekday. I would recommend coming here for brunch or lunch and trying some of the great dishes, then working the rest of the day. I particularly like the counter seats by the windows, which looked like a nice spot to sit and work from. The WiFi is good and there are lots of power outlets. The cafe feels bright and modern, but it was a little noisy at times (people talking and slightly too loud music).
