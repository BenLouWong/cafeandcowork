A small coffee shop right across from exit 5 of Nangang Expo MRT. The interior is small, with one high table and a couple of seats by the window. But, it feels bright, modern, quite comfortable and not very busy. The menu selection is good, they offer plenty of coffee, some good Taiwanese tea, and some small snacks as well. The WiFi is very fast, there are some power outlets, but no restroom, so it's probably only suitable for short work sessions.
