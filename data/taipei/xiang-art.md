    Tucked away on the 2nd floor of this art supply shop you'll find a perfect cafe for quiet work or study. Not only is the space quiet and comfortable, it's also worth trying the surprisingly tasty beef curry, which is very reasonably priced, including a drink and a small dessert as well.

    On a nice day you can also enjoy the outdoor seating on the balcony. I guess the only minor fault I could find was the lack of power outlets (which from what I could tell, all tables don't have access to). Other than that, it's definitely a great place!

    *Note that the shop opens at 10:30, but the cafe opens at 11:00*

    響ART隱身在畫材店二樓，是一個非常安靜寬敞的咖啡店，和它本身的藝文氣質相映奇趣。不僅空間本身非常寧靜舒適，他們的餐點也驚人得好吃實惠，我十分推薦他們的牛肉咖哩，超優惠的價格居然還包含甜點和飲料。

    天氣好的時候你可以在陽台上悠閒的享受陽光，如果你不知道要做些什麼，可以在這裡買水彩套組玩填色遊戲。我想唯一一個小小的缺點是稍嫌缺乏插座，除此之外這裡可以說近乎完美！

    需要注意樓下的美術用品店十點半開，而咖啡店的營業時間則是從十一點開始。
