A tiny cafe near Beimen station just across from the Beimen North Gate landmark, and just next door to another popular cafe called [MKCR](/taipei/mkcrtw/). The inside space only has counter seats along the windows, perfect for getting fresh air on a nice day. There are also a couple of seats outside. The menu is quite big, with coffee, tea, and desserts. Unfortunately there are no restrooms, so I guess this is really only suitable for a short stay.

Minimum order 1 drink, and there is a two hour limit on weekends.
