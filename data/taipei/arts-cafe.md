In-house coffee roasting; decent dark roast, boring light roast; squat toilet only. Second floor is bright with varied small table options. Third floor has large work tables, doubles as art space, but relies on artificial lighting since window is mostly blocked by an ad. Popular with business customers in early afternoon; mostly empty before 13:00.
