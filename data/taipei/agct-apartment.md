A nice "hidden" cafe located on the 3rd floor (you'll need to use the elevator). The natural lighting is great thanks to the big windows all around the cafe. For working, I like the soft chairs by the large worktable, which also have access to power thanks to a power strip. I ordered the ice black tea, and the BLT sandwich was great! Be sure to arrive early, since the opening hours are quite short and it filled up fast on a weekday!
