I recently discovered this cafe one evening while I had some spare time around Zhongxiao Fuxing. It's only a short walk from the station exit. During the evening on a weekday it was very quiet and there was only one other customer. Upon entering the cafe, the owner's dog will greet you with a friendly bark, although he never left the comfort of the sofa (that seems to be his regular spot!)

The interior feels cozy, comfortable lighting, and good seats. The menu is quite large, with all the usual selection. I ordered earl grey tea, which came in a huge cup. It was good, but since I only had 1 hour to get some work done I wasn't able to finish it unfortunately.
