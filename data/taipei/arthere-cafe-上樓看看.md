Decent cafe to sit and work at. When I arrived after lunch it was already very busy, so I guess it's good to arrive early. The second floor is definitely the best place to sit. Plenty of seating areas and lots of natural light. It can be a little noisy at peak times. The food menu is quite extensive but I didn't try any food. Lots of drink options but no regular plain black tea (only milk tea and non-caffeine tea). That was a little disappointing. I tried the chocolate banana shake instead, which was really good though. Fast WiFi and power outlets on the floor.
