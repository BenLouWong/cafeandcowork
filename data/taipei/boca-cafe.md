A great little cafe near Yongchun MRT that is open late (until 23:30). It was surprisingly busy late on a weekday, almost full with people studying, working, or chatting. Nice modern interior and very comfortable chairs. There are some power outlets along the walls, the WiFi worked but was a little slow. Good drinks selection, with plenty of non-caffeine options for late night work, and the desserts/waffles looked very good.
