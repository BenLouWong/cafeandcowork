On a weekend this was a nice cafe to work from. I imagine it would also be a good spot on a weekday. I like that the tea selection is large, although it seems most of the tea is fruit flavored. They also have homemade desserts that all look quite nice. The WiFi is fast, and the seats along the left wall have access to power outlets.
