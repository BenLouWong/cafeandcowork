A fantastic cafe when the weather is nice, since they open the large doors. The WiFi is a little slow, and there aren't very many power outlets. The seats are also not the most comfortable. But the vibe does kind of make up for the drawbacks. Also, they probably have the most stylish restroom cafe in Taipei, which features a tree! Not to be confused with the boven library downstairs (paid access only).
