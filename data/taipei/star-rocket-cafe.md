Star Rocket Café is located on the 11F of the Syntrend department store. On a weekday it's very suitable for working, as it's usually quiet and plenty of seats. The large worktable in particular is comfortable and good for working. They offer basic food and drinks. The drawbacks are that the WiFi is a little slow and disconnects occasionally, and the opening hours are quite short. Extension cords are available if you ask the staff.

To reach the cafe, enter the main entrance, take a right and find the elevators. Take the elevator up to the 11th floor and follow signs for the Star Rocket Cafe.
