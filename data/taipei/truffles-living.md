A quirky name and an odd description ("bar restaurant furniture store"). Despite this, it is in fact very work friendly and definitely worth visiting. The interior is rustic, filled with vintage and antique furniture. The atmosphere is calm, noise level is good, and it doesn't get very crowded throughout the day. The environment is clean and the space is quite large with multiple seating areas, including several large worktables. Most seats near the walls have power outlets. Friendly and very attentive staff. 

The two main drawbacks are WiFi and price. The WiFi is usually very slow and difficult to use (even for light browsing). I find myself always using a mobile hotspot instead. Food and drinks are definitely on the pricey side. The quality is good, but the value is perhaps a little low. Also, some seats right under the AC can get a little cold.
