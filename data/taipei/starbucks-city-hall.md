Take the escalator up outside metro exit 2. The space is quite large, but can get very crowded, especially in the afternoon/evening and on weekends. There are no restrooms inside the Starbucks so you'll have to use the public restrooms available in the department store or by the MRT, which is quite a big inconvenience. The seats furthest in overlooking the big intersection have a nice view.
