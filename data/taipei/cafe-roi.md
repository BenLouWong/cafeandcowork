A simple cafe near Taipei Arena. The interior and furniture is fairly ordinary, but there are some nice personal touches, like paintings, magazines, and a fish tank. It's clean and the staff was friendly. Decent WiFi, but lacking power outlets. I saw one table near the back wall that has access to power. Nice drinks selection and the food options seem pretty good as well, so it might be a good cafe to have lunch at.
