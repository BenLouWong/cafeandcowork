Time limit policy of 1.5H if crowded (no enforcement observed). Minimum (1) drink per guest; subsequent drinks are 20% off.

Overall the space is very well lit with a spacious layout. There are two large tables for groups of 4-6 and all others are 2-seaters. The music and conversation may be loud for people who are sensitive to sound, pleasant for those who enjoy background bustle. Popular for young professionals.
