A small cafe near Nangang Expo. The wooden floors and thoughtful interior gives it a very cozy and homey feel. The seats are comfortable and the counter is good for standing as well. The wifi is good and if you need power then there are lots of outlets hidden under the countertop. The menu selection is perhaps a little small. The tea was good, but quite small considering the price. The best thing about this cafe was that it never got very crowded or noisy throughout the day on a weekday.
