A nice, small cafe near Yongkang Street. The interior feels modern and has a relaxing atmosphere. It was not very busy throughout the day on a weekday. The WiFi is great, and there are some power outlets along the left side wall, but none at the larger table. I would recommend the "Happy Hour" coffee/tea + cake set for 330. Both the tea and the tiramisu that I ordered were good.
