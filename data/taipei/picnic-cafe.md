A popular work and study cafe, so be sure to arrive early to get a good seat. It fills up quickly in the afternoon! Their quiches are really quite good, very moist and fluffy. If you want a proper sized meal, get the quiche & salad set and a scone. You also get a discount on drinks if you order a meal. Fast WiFi and plenty of power outlets.
