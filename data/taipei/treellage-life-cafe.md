A very quiet cafe near Taipei City Hall with a focus on tea. The interior is quite spacious with lots of seating and plenty of natural light. On a weekday it was very calm and quiet, with only a couple of people working and studying. The menu is simple, offering tea, coffee, and some non-caffeine options. Although the tea price is a little high, it does come with free refills of hot water, and the cookies are complimentary. Great wifi, plenty of power outlets, and very friendly staff.
