A fairly large cafe with two floors, lots of seating options, and very comfortable chairs. Good WiFi and plenty of power outlets as well. I really like the second floor since there are two large work tables, great for working. Although the second floor closed early (at 16:00), so I had to move downstairs. I'm not sure why or if that's always the case.

The vibe is quite nice, not too busy on a Friday afternoon, and not very noisy either (especially on the second floor). The menu is very large, with a lot of food options, so it's probably a good place to have a working lunch, although I imagine it might get a little busy during lunch time (I'll have to come back and check some time).
