Relaxing atmosphere, with nice background ambient music (both high and low tempo). There are many tables, but most seem to not have access to power. If you need power you should try to get a counter seat. The outdoor seating area is large, and looks like a great option when the weather is nice. Good drinks selection and very reasonable prices! One minor downside might be that most of the chairs are quite hard, and perhaps not very comfortable for extended stays.
