This Dreamers location actually feels more like a co-working space than a cafe. Huge spacious interior, with lots of seating areas across two floors. I especially like the counter seats on the second floor overlooking the first floor. As with other Dreamers locations, there are plenty of food and drink options available.

There are some unfortunate downsides though. The WiFi was basically unusable (extremely slow and unstable) and the restroom facilities are very basic (no soap provided). It's a shame, if it wasn't for these things, this place has the potential to be one of the best work spots in Taipei.
