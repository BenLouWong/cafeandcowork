A great work-friendly cafe by Taipei City Hall station. The first floor looks unassuming, but head downstairs and you'll find a very large space with many different seating areas, including sofas, small tables and large tables. Good for both individuals and large groups. Despite being underground the space is well-lit and has a good vibe. It can get a little noisy though when it gets busy. The menu has a little of everything, with good drinks and both desserts and proper meals. Beware of the minimum spend rules. From 10-17 there is a minimum spend of NT$ 200. From 15-21 there is a minimum spend of NT$ 300. If you stay all day you will need to pay both! Decent WiFi, lots of power outlets, and attentive staff.
