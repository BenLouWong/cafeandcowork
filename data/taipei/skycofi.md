This pay-to-use space offers an interesting concept for remote workers and digital nomads. It is a combination of both a cafe and a coworking space, offering two different types of plans, depending on what you need (more on that later). With plenty of seating choices, a large menu for both food and drink, fast wifi, and power outlets, it pretty much as everything you'd need. Another bonus worth mentioning is that they allow you to bring your own food!

The space is located on the top floor of same building as the SkyCo coworking space (16F). It's quite large, but not huge, so you might want to arrive early to grab one of the popular counter seats facing the windows. There are also standing tables and plenty of small tables. The menu selection is quite impressive, with lots of drinks and food. The panini sandwich and toast were both well made, really tasty, and not too expensive either.

As for payment, you can choose between two different plans, depending on what you prefer:

**Worker Plan:**

- Unlimited "basic" drinks (free of charge)
- Unlimited small snacks (free of charge)
- Upgrade a "premium" drink for an additional cost
- First hour: 100 NTD
- Each additional half hour: 50 NTD
- Day pass: 390 NTD
- (Price is capped at 450 without a day pass)

**Minimum Order Plan:**

- The more you spend, the longer you can stay
- 2 hours: spend 100 NTD
- Unlimited time: spend 250 NTD

So which plan is best? Well, it depends. If you're planning to order a drink and food (sandwich) then the "Minimum Order Plan" is probably best since you will likely spend at least 250 NTD, which lets you stay the whole day. However, if you only want drinks (or plan to bring your own food), then the worker plan is probably best. I would say the conceptive is quite creative and great for catering to different peoples' needs. However, it does feel a little complicated at first.
