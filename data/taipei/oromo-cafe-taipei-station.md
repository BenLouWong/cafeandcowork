A very unique cafe, and probably one of the quirkiest cafes in Taipei. Each floor has a different style with lots of different seating options depending on what you're looking for. The top floor even has an indoor slide! The WiFi is ok, but could be better. Most seats have access to power, and the menu selection is really good (this oromo location offers food, whereas the other locations don't). This is definitely a cafe you have to visit at least once in Taipei!
