A small cafe located a little bit of a walk away from Houshanpi station. It's quiet and comfortable. There are a couple of small tables and window seats, both options suitable for working. The WiFi is decent, there are power outlets, and reasonably priced drinks and snacks are available. I've tried the oolong tea and the breakfast plate, both were tasty.
