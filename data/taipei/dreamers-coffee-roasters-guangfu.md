There are several Dreamers Coffee locations in Taipei, but this one near Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall is my favorite. They open at 7 every day, so it's a great place to work in the mornings, especially since it usually gets very busy after lunch. Good natural light thanks to the large windows all around. The large worktable (with power outlets) is great to work from. There are also power outlets by all the smaller tables. The WiFi works for basic browsing, but it's not super fast. Cheap drinks, but tea selection is slightly lacking in my opinion.
