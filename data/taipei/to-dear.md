A hidden gem near Guting MRT. The easiest way to access the cafe is to walk through the market area near Exit 4. The cafe itself has a very creatively decorated interior. I especially like the small details like the small plants in the tables. There's also a large outdoor seating area and apparently an art gallery as well. The best thing is that it was very quiet and very few people during the entire afternoon on a weekday, great for getting some focused work done. There's WiFi, power outlets, and a large menu with lots of tea. Furthermore the staff was very friendly and welcoming!
