A quirky but cozy cafe with interesting decorations. The inside is quite large with plenty of seating options. I especially like the music selection, which was a mix of soft low-fi, piano, jazz, and instrumental music. The WiFi is great, the food/drinks options are really good (you can have a proper meal here), and the staff was very friendly. There are some drawbacks though. Most of the seats are hard and not very comfortable for extended stays, and some of the larger tables are lacking access to power outlets. In any case, it's nice to spend time here in the morning when it's very quiet, it got a little busy during lunch time though.
