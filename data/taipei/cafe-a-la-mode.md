    There are many great cafes around Zhongshan MRT, but most of them get very busy, even on weekdays. Recently I discovered Cafe a la mode, which was a quiet and less busy place to spend the afternoon working from. The interior feels bright and modern, and there are plenty of seats to choose from, including one large work table suitable for larger groups. There's decent WiFi, some power outlets, and comfortable chairs. The food menu is quite large, so it's probably a good place to have lunch or dinner as well, while getting some work done!
