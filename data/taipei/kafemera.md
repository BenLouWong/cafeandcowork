Not very busy during the morning on a weekday. Large interior, although the big room feels a little dark and lacks natural light. Good drink selection, including oatly as an option. There's also a small selection of snacks, the banana and hazelnut toast was really tasty, and perfect if you need a small snack. Some power outlets and the WiFi is decent.
