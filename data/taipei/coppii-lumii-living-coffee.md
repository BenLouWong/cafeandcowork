Nice place to sit and work at during a weekday afternoon. It was a little busy when we arrived just after lunch time but we got a table after waiting a little bit. Decent drink selection, and the food seems good (but I didn't try any). Lots of power outlets, good natural light, WiFi is a little slow but stable.
