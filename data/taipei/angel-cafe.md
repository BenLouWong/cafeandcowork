Trendy cafe/restaurant, modern interior, dim lighting, and lounge music. It's workable, but might be crowded/noisy during lunch and dinner time. There are two large worktables in the back, counter seating, and more tables near the front. Lots of power outlets, but the WiFi was very slow (at least in the front seating area). Good food, and the portion size was quite good, but a little pricey.
