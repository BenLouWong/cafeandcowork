Everday Mooonday is an art gallery with a cafe in the basement. The building and architecture is definitely special. The cafe was very quiet and empty just after opening, but filled up after a couple of hours. WiFi slightly unstable (disconnects for a short time from time to time), and some power outlets didn't work.
