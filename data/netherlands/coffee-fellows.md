A very workable cafe near the central station in The Hague. On a weekday there were a lot of people sitting working/studying on their laptops. Fairly quiet and cozy atmosphere. The counter seats by the windows are a good option (with power outlets available on the table). There's WiFi as well, not super fast, but good enough. Very friendly staff, and plenty of food and drink options (both savory and sweet).
