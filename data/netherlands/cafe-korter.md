The popular cafe [Daen's Cafe](https://cafeandcowork.com/netherlands/daens-cafe/) next door was completely full, so I ended up here instead. During the afternoon on a weekday it was pretty much empty. The staff was friendly, and said it was fine to use laptops. Plenty of seats, very fast wifi, power outlets. There's no "menu", but they have tea, coffee, and pressed sandwiches (which were tasty). The vibe is a little unclear though, it feels like a mix between a cafe, pub, bar, and restaurant. Anyways, it was a solid place to sit and get some work done.
