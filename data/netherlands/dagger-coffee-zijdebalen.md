A tiny cafe just outside the city center of Utrecht. The cafe really is quite tiny, but has lots of natural light and a cozy feel. The downside is it can be pretty tricky to get a seat. Weekdays mornings are usually completely packed, so not really the type of place to bring your laptop. They have some nice brunch food and there's good fast WiFi.
