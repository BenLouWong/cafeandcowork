review:
  en: The cafe is very spacious but lacks seats for people who are alone. I felt bad for occupying the whole table for four seats. Anyhow, despite the google maps reviews saying that the WiFi is bad, I didn't have much problem at all. I ran a few speedtests and the fastest it recorded was 180 Mbps. However, there were some tests that scored around 30 Mbps, so I have to say it wasn't consistent. The music is really quiet. There are a few outdoor seatings for the smokers as well. Power outlets, you gotta find a good seat that's close to it.
