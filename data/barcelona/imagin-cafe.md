review:
  en: This place is operated by the Imagin Bank. Technically, you may need an Imagin Bank account, but the entrance staff were welcoming and did not check with me. I didn't even buy a coffee I think. According to a Google Maps review, the wifi is unusable, but I did not have any issues with it. The staff helped me out to connect it. The place is roomy and has plenty of power outlets. If you go upstairs, there is ample space to chill and relax like sofas and some books to read. I cannot recall the exact speed of the wifi, but I do remember having no trouble working.
