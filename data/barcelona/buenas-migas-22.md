review:
  en: One of the cleanest and prettiest Buenas Migas in town. The cafe is spacious and has a plenty of seats for individuals. Power outlets are limited for seats along the wall but that is 70% of the seats so you should be able to find one. WiFi is quite fast. They say that it may get slow during the peak hours but it was still measuring mid 100Mbps. Later in the afternoon when there were less people, it was measuring around 300Mbps. It is also a plus that there's a bike racks right outside where you can see.
