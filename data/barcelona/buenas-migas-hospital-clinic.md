review:
  en: This Buenas Migas is very close from a station so access by train is amazing. There are only 8 tables by the wall that has power outlet. The food selection is not the best but has enough things if you need a quick bite. The coffee tasted little off for the one I ordered but maybe it was just a one off. The music was bit loud, and they were playing a lot of bossa nova mix of popular pop songs, so if you're easily distracted and can't stop the urge of singing along, make sure to bring a ANC headphone. And maybe not the best place to make calls for that reason.
