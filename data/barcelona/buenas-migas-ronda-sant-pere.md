review:
  en: This place is located right next to the Urquinaona station. Has some seats for couples, but also there are sofa seats by the wall with some power outlets. If you can secure one of those seats, you're good for the entire day. This Buenas Migas has a larger selections of food other than focaccia as well, such as salads and some pastries. Just be careful how concentrated you get because while I was staying there, someone snuck beside us and try to snatch the phone on the table. We noticed and he ran away but just beware of your surroundings!
