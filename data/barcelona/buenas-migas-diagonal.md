review:
  en: This buenas migas is probably the best yet. It is full of individual seats with power outlets. If you go before 3PM, you will surely find a seat with an outlet. It does get a bit busy around 3, but I never had a trouble finding a seat. Coffee is cheap and tastes good, and the selection of the food here is good, from salad to dozen different focaccia. The WiFi is fast and no need to reconnect once you are connected. One down side may be the seats. You can only get a chair with close to none back support, or the bench attached to the wall, which is not the most comfortable thing in the world. However, given the place's overall cleanliness and how quiet it is for a cafe, I will come back many times!!
