A small cozy cafe in The Hague. Order downstairs and then grab a seat on the second floor. The counter seats have a nice view overlooking the street. Legroom is a little tight though, and it was cold when I first arrived since apparently the heating wasn't on. The staff later turned on the heating. WiFi is available, but very slow. The panini was alright. Lots of coffee available, but no regular black tea. The fresh mint tea was nice though.
