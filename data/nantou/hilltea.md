A fantastic cafe for tea enthusiast. You can choose the tea you want and then brew it yourself at the table. The staff will tell you what water temperature to use, and how long to brew the tea for. It's also very workable, thanks for fast WiFi and power outlets at every table. The cakes looked very nice as well!
