A new cafe that recently opened in Zhongxing New Villeage in Nantou. It's small, but feels very cozy and nicely designed. There are a couple of tables available, suitable for work. Power outlets at every seat, but no WiFi unfortunately. Nice coffee, tea, and the scones look tasty! It's a little pricey for the area, but I like the vibe!
