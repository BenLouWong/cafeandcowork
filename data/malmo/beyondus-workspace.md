A great little workspace in central Malmö located inside Beyond Us, which consists of a cafe and a shop on the first floor, and furniture viewing room, workspace, and meeting rooms on the second floor. The workspace consists of several tables and counter seats along the windows, overlooking the canal and walking street.

The price is very affordable. 100 kr for a day pass (which includes tea and coffee). You can also buy a 10-day pack, with a small discount, or a monthly pass. Although there is no food or snacks in the workspace, you can buy food at the cafe downstairs and bring up to the second floor.

Although the workspace is located inside the furniture shop, it was never crowded or noisy. It definitely made for a suitable place to spend the day working. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
