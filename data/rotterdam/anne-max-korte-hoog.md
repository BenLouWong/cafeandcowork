Anne & Max Korte Hoog is conveniently located near one of the busiest and most popular areas in Rotterdam city center, just a 5-minute walk from Beurs station. Surprisingly, even on bustling weekend afternoons, this caf√© manages to maintain a cozy and tranquil ambiance. They thoughtfully provide extension cords for charging, and the best part is that they allow laptops! The food is delightful, and the service is excellent."
