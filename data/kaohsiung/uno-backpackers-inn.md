A simple but good hotel/hostel. Location is very good, just a few minutes walk from Central Park MRT station. There are lots of shops, restaurants, and cafes nearby. Coffee Wake up cafe is just across the street, one of my favorite cafes in Kaohsiung.

The shared facilities are very suitable for working, and were very clean and tidy. The kitchen area is quite big. The rooftop space has fantastic views!
