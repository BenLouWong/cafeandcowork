review:
  en: This library has plenty of seats and outlets to choose from. There are quite a few people working with their laptops open so seems like a normal thing to do. Wifi is not the fastest but stable. One thing that was annoying is that they probably block ports other than 80 or 443, so you can't SSH, connect to Postgresql DB, connecting to VPN, etc. For taking calls, if you go towards the kids area, you might feel more comfortable talking since there are kids who are also loud. However, there are signs that says no loud talking on the phone so not the best place when you have a day full of meetings. The out door benches are also available and the wifi speed doesn't drop too much even if you're seated outside. There's a supermarket right next to it so you can go grab some drinks if you need any. Edit - I could bypass the restriction by using Obfuscated Servers with Open VPN (TCP) protocol on NordVPN.
