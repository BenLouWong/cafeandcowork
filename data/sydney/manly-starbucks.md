review:
  en: This Starbucks is right in front of the beach and you can see the ocean from the seat inside. There are a couple of seats with outlets but not all of them. Also, the bathroom was out of service. WiFi password is just shown on the counter so easy to connect and no issue of signing in to use like they do in other countries.
