One of many cafes in the area. As with most Starbucks they get pretty busy, especially with lots of students in the area. The interior is fairly large and there are lots of seats available inside and outside. There is WiFi but I was unable to connect to it. You might need to choose a seat where the WiFi signal is very strong. Two restrooms available, one for men and one for women.
