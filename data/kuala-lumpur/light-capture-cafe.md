The opening times are a bit confusing. In their Instagram account they have different opening times than in Google Maps. The caf√© is very spacious with two floors and different seat options (couches, taller tables that you can use as standing tables, regular chairs, tall chairs to name a few). The natural lighting entering from the windows is nice. The restrooms were clean. There was unlimited water for free. The temperature was good. The main downside is that the music was quite loud and too repetitive for my taste, I asked to turn it a bit down, they said that it was possible but I didn't feel any difference in the volume. I was one of the first customers for the day but it can get crowded, so not sure about seating availability, although they have many seating spaces. Power outlets were available only at the ground floor for a few tables, this was another downside. The WiFi was working well. The iced cappuccino was average, not too good, not too bad. There were a few bunnies as pets at the ground floor which can be disturbing for some people. You can find the complete menu in their website. You place the order online by scanning a QR code on your table.
