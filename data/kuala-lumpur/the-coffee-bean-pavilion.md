Note that as the Google Maps location might be in the wrong location. The cafe is located opposite the illy Caff√© Pavilion at the L3 outdoor area. Unfortunately both the cafe wifi and the mall wifi were both really bad and unstable. It would work for 5 minutes and then cut out for 5 minutes. Very annoying. There are some power outlets along the back wall.
