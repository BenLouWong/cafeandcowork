The lobby area at the Hoxton hotel in Williamsburg is definitely one of my favorite spots in the area. It's usually very quiet, plenty of comfortable seating including large worktables, decent WiFi, some power outlets, and a small cafe area selling snacks and drinks. The opening hours are limited now (due to covid). But you could easily buy a coffee just before the cafe closes and then sit and work during the rest of the afternoon.
