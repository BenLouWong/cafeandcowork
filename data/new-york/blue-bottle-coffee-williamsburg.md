I usually don't find Blue Bottle Coffee to be especially comfortable to work from. However, this location has comfortable cushioned seats along the walls by the windows, good enough to sit and work for a couple of hours.

On a weekday morning it was quiet and not very busy, although I imagine it might get busy around lunch time or in the afternoon. There are plenty of power outlets, although the large worktables in the middle don't have any. The WiFi is a little slow, but it works.

(The restroom sink and toilet flush was broken during my visit. Hopefully that was just a temporary issue though...)
