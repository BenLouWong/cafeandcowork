Easily one of my new favorite cafe work spots in NYC. Silver Light Tavern is a bar/restaurant, however, during the day they open their space for a small cafe. The interior looks really cool, featuring dark colors and lots of natural light, giving a very cool vibe.

It wasn't busy on a weekday so we could easily get a large table for ourselves. The booth seating is super comfortable, idle for some laptop work. Every table also has power and the WiFi is very fast. There's a decent selection of pastries, cooked food, tea and coffee. So if you want to stop by for lunch that's an option as well. Also worth mentioning, the staff was very friendly and welcoming!
