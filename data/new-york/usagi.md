A great cafe/bookstore in Dumbo. When you enter it looks like a shop, but keep going in and you'll find a cafe selling delicious authentic Japanese lunch dishes, and a decent selection of tea and coffee.

The space is a lot bigger than I initially thought. There are lots of different seating areas, but I prefer the large table and counter seats by the entrance, where you get a lot of natural light.

The WiFi is good and there are some power outlets along the walls. The cafe was mostly very quiet, with only a couple of people sitting and reading or working on laptops. Lunch time got a little busy, but mostly people getting takeout lunch.

Overall a fantastic place to sit and get work done. It's definitely the type of place I could sit and work all day, especially since you can get a great lunch as well!
