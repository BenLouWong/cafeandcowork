A very popular coffee shop in Williamsburg. I've tried going several times to work but it's always been full. If you want a seat, be sure to arrive early (ideally before 9). Also, be prepared to queue up for ordering. The coffee was very good, and the tea was nice, but the cup size was very small (not sure if they do water refills). There are some snacks as well.

The interior is spacious, bright, and has a nice vibe. Even though it fills up very quickly it never got noisy. Plenty of power outlets along the wall side seats, and the WiFi is very fast (180+ Mbps).
