A small coffee shop right by the river in Williamsburg. It's mostly a takeout place, but there are some nice counter seats with views overlooking lower manhattan and brooklyn bridge. There's coffee, snacks, ice cream, good WiFi, and lots of power outlets. A great spot for getting some work done for a couple of hours on a weekday.

There is a restroom, although it was unavailable during my visit.
