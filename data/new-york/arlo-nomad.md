The hotel lobby from the ground floor looks mediocre, but the secret is to go to the second floor. There is a beautiful "studio" space that has high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, and bookshelves, with nice comfortable seating, large tables, and outlets. Hidden gem. The wifi is unrestricted but you need to put in a code if you're not staying in the hotel. The code `nomad2023` works as of 2023-06-11. Unfortunately, the WiFi is nominally 4 mbps, but the latency make it almost unusable -- this is a better place to go if you don't need wifi.
