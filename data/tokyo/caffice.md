I enjoy spending some time here to get some work done. Food/drink is expensive, so I recommend grabbing lunch here (which offers a food and drink combo).

There are counter seats and large work tables in the back. Fast WiFi (although it does slow down a bit when it fills up), and lots of power outlets. They even have Ethernet ports!

Weekends are quite popular, so it's good to arrive in the early afternoon before it fills up. There is a two hour time limit (per drink?), but doesn't seem to be strictly enforced. I guess when there's a queue they might ask you to leave.
