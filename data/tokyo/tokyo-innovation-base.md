A free "coworking" space provided by Tokyo city.

Before you visit, make sure you download the app and register an account. When you enter the building take the escalator up to the second floor where you'll find the reception.

Scan your QR code at the entrance gates, and then grab a badge.

There's seating on both the 2nd and 3rd floors. I arrived on a weekday afternoon and it was *very* crowded. If you want to find a proper seat you should probably arrive early. Apparently it is fairly empty on weekends.

The WiFi is quite cumbersome to connect to. You have to download the TOKYO FREE Wi-Fi profile in order to connect to the WiFi. Instructions are available here: https://wi-fi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/

The clip on your badge can be exchanged for a free coffee from the coffee machine. You can bring your own drinks instead if you prefer.
