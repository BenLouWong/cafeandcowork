A fantastic cafe for working near Takadanobaba station. The 2nd floor is best for working, so when you arrive, let the staff know that you'd like a seat on the 2nd floor, and they'll give you a seat number and a QR code for ordering.

Drinks are quiet basic, and a little pricey for what you get, but at least the space is very comfortable, great for a work or study session.

Two restrooms available, one on 1F and one on 3F.
