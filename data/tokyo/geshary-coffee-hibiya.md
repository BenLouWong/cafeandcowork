A huge cafe spanning four floors with power and wifi. The upper floors have small tables and large worktables. The main downside is the menu is quite small and very expensive, especially if you don't drink/appreciate expensive coffee. I asked if they had any other drinks and they had a "secret" menu with juice (which was also very expensive).
