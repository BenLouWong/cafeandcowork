A popular Starbucks located on the 6th floor of Tokyu Plaza in Harajuku-Omotesando area. It's a fairly nice place to sit and work at, especially in the morning before the department store opens (in this case use the elevator entrance to access the Starbucks). There's a fairly large indoor area, with one large work table. The outdoor area is very large, which is great to use when the weather is good.
