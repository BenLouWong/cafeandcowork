A new Blue Bottle coffee shop recently opened in Daikanyama, part of the Forest Gate building. It's probably one of the best workable Blue Bottle locations I've found in Tokyo, with large worktables, comfortable seating, and fast WiFi. The only caveat is that there are no power outlets. It was almost empty on a weekday morning, so it's a great place to get some work done early in the day.
