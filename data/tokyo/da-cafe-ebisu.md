A small cafe located inside the Prince Smart Inn Ebisu hotel, next to the lobby. Opens very early if that's what you need. Seating is quite good for working, with a large worktable and some smaller tables by the windows. The cafe itself doesn't have WiFi, but, if you look around you can find the hotel WiFi password. I didn't see any power outlets. It was fairly busy in the afternoon on a weekday.
