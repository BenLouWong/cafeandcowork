A cafe with a lovely interior and amazing staff. I love coming here just to chat up with the manager. Their drinks are great, and their pastries are also delicious. The Wifi is spotty downstairs so I highly recommend going upstairs for better connection and some power outlets. I've seen the manager smoking on the balcony. I don't know if that's their official smoking space but I guess he's nice enough to let you smoke if you ask. For some reason, it gets super crowded during the weekend.
