A brand new Starbucks (opened March 2024) in the new Sakura Stage building in Shibuya. It's located on the 3rd floor and has two separate seating areas. The second seating room is open until 9pm, and the main seating room is open until 10pm. The WiFi is very fast, but few power outlets. Also, I'm not really sure where the restrooms are. I think you'd have to find the nearest public restrooms in the building.
