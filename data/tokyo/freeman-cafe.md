A nice cafe/restaurant close to Shibuya and Harajuku. Interesting drinks and a nice variety of cooked food. Their tuna rice dish is really good. Pasta and pizza is also good! Power available by most seats. WiFi speed is fine, but it can be a bit flaky at peak hours. I wouldn’t go here for downloading huge files. There's a smoking section, but during the morning or lunch time I rarely notice smoke smell. Note that there is a time-limit when it's crowded and I guess they won't ask you to leave unless there's a queue to get in.
