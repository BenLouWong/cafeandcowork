A really cool place in Shibuya. It started out as a maker space (with 3D printers, laser cutters, and more), and then they added a café as well.
Food & Drinks: I haven’t tried the food, but they have some nice drinks. Their ginger ale is awesome (real ginger!)
Power Outlets: Plenty of power outlets. If you ask for it they’ll help you out with an extension cord, if needed.
WiFi: Good WiFi, never had any issues.
