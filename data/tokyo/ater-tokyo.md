A Swedish cafe located in the outskirts of Tokyo on the east side of the city. It is a very cozy and relaxing place, with a large outdoor terrace overlooking the river. The menu offers Swedish open-face sandwiches, pastries, coffee, and tea. Definitely worth taking a trip out there! Restrooms are just next to the cafe (public restrooms).
