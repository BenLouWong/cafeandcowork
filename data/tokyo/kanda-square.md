This is a office building but the ground floor is usually open for public. Inside the building, there is a small lobby area where there are seats and plugs under the benches on the wall. Also, if you go outside, there are standing "desks" with power sockets as well. There is a Kanda Square public WiFi which is not the fastest but usually gets the job done. If you need any drinks or food, the building has a Lawson, Summit (supermarket), and Tully's + a few more dine-in restaurants.
