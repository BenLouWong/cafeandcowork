Tucked away on the 2nd floor above a clothes shop. Large seating space, with plenty of options. The large worktable with high chairs is nice for working. I only saw a single power outlet though. Also, there is WiFi but I had a lot of issues connecting to it. Once I was connected, it was too slow to use, so I ended up tethering from my phone instead. As someone who doesn't drink coffee, I was glad to see that they have black tea on the menu, which was brewed very properly!
