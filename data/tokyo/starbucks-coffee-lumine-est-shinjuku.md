Great for early morning work since the Starbucks opens much earlier than the rest of the LUMINE EST department store in Shinjuku. It was basically empty until around 10am. There's very fast WiFi thanks to the free Shinjuku WiFi. No power outlets though. To access the Starbucks before the department store opens you have to use the escalator available from the road side outside entrance (the underground entrances from within the station are closed).
