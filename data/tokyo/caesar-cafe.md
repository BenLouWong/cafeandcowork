Korean style cafe serving shaved ice and playing k-pop music. It's a little hectic, but the 2nd floor window seats are great for working, especially in the morning when it's a little quieter, or if you put on your noise-cancelling headphones. The cafe wifi is a little slow, but you can use the Shinjuku Free WiFi instead, which was much faster. The menu does mention a 90-minute time limit, but it doesn't seem to be enforced (at least not on a weekdays).
