The Starbucks Reserve Roastery near Nakameguro is a massive 4 story building, with each floor featuring a different theme. It can get quite busy, so if you want to use it as a work spot then early mornings or late evenings are the best option. The upper floors have plenty of seating options, and WiFi is available. I didn't see any power outlets, so be sure to arrive fully charged! Plenty of good food options and a large drink selection.
