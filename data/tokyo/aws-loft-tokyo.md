Easily one of the best places to work from in Tokyo. It's free to use, all you need is an AWS account to register. Plenty of comfortable seats, fast WiFi, lots of power outlets, and amazing views. There's a small cafe selling drinks and snacks, as well as a vending machine. It can get busy so be sure to arrive early to grab a seat.

**Access**: From the street, take the escalator up to the 3rd floor (follow the signs to the office). At the elevators tell the guard that you're going to AWS Loft and they'll let you through the gate. Head to the 17th floor.

**Signup**: At the reception you'll have to fill out a first time registration form with your details and supply an AWS account ID. They also ask for a business card or ID/passport. The reception staff spoke good English. Future visits only require filling in your email address.

**Space**: The space looks really impressive with large windows offering amazing views of the surrounding area. There are different zones for working, relaxing, and meetings. There is also an "ask an AWS expert" corner, which is a fun concept. Lots of power outlets. There is music playing.

**Seating**: There are large shared work tables with soft and hard chairs. The soft chairs are really comfortable actually. There's also counter-style seating along the back wall, and couch-style seating along another wall.

**Wifi**: Good. 100 Mbit down. 150 Mbit up. 6-18ms ping. We'll have to see how it holds up when the co-working space eventually gets more crowded.

**Food/drinks**: There is a cafe inside where you can buy drinks, snacks, and bentos. Prices are reasonable.

**Meeting rooms**: There are several meeting rooms that (I think) can be booked for free as well. I haven't really looked into it yet, though.

**Overall**: A really cool space, comfortable work area, good location right by Meguro station. The main drawback is that the space is only open from 10-18 weekdays (closed on weekends). Definitely a good alternative to Lodge, which has become very crowded lately.
