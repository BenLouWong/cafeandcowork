One of my favorite cozy coffee shops in Shimokitazawa. It's small, with only a couple of tables, and counter seats, so it's not really the type of place you'd hang out and work for too long. But if you're in the area and you want a nice drink and some desserts then this is a great spot. There's wifi and power outlets as well.
