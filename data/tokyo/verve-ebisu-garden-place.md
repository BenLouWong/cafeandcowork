A bright, airy atmosphere with spacious interiors and large windows providing ample natural light. There's an outdoor seating area perfect for pleasant days, and a large indoor space. For working the counter seats are definitely the most comfortable.

There is fast WiFi (but limited to 3 hours per device per day). Few power outlets. From Ebisu station it is only a ~10 minute walk using the Ebisu Skywalk.

Toilets are inside the DCM DIY shop, on the same floor, but a bit far away.
