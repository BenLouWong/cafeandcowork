One of my favorite spots to work in the morning since they offer free toast with a drink until 11am. To be fair though, the drinks are pricey, so you don't really save any money. The vibe is quite old school with a mix of locals, tourists, and workers. My favorite seats are the counter seats overlooking the street below.
