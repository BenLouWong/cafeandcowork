This cafe is on a small quiet street near Shin-Okubo station. It's calm, quiet and cozy, even on a Sunday. I believe the owner might be from Taiwan, and they serve Taiwanese Oolong tea, which was very nice. There's good WiFi and power outlets. They don't accept cards though, so be sure to have cash or PayPay.
