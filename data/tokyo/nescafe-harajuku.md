A large and spacious cafe near Harajuku station. Surprisingly not very crowded considering the area, but I guess the vibe is a bit "corporate-y" so it's probably not the most popular cafe for tourists. In any case, it's a great spot to sit and get some done. Fast wifi, and especially the counter seats are great if you need power.
