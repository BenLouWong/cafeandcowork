This Tully's is located on the 3rd floor of the LaQua department store. If you happen to be in the area, it's a good spot to get some work done. I especially like the counter seats by the windows. You can access the cafe in the early morning (before the department store opens). There is a time-limit, but I'm not sure how strictly it is enforced (I usually don't stay for more than 1.5 hours anyways).
