They finally have a fast WiFi, no matter where you sit. Counter seats have power outlets, otherwise it can be a little tricky if you need to charge. Can get very busy during peak/lunch hours, but good for mornings or late afternoons. The nearest toilets are outside the cafe, one floor up inside Shibuya Stream, which is a little inconvenient for longer stays.
