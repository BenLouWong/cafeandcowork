A very small cafe filled with bookshelves. The second floor is workable, but it is very compact/narrow, and the WiFi was not particularly stable. The restroom is hidden behind a bookshelf. Also the background music is quite loud, so you might find that to be a bit distracting. It's a fun spot to check out though.
