Quite a nice place, but it's very pricey for what it is, and there was a 1.5 hour time limit on weekends (not sure about weekdays). Quite a large outdoor seating area (pets allowed). I ordered a muffin, which wasn't really worth the price (quite dry). There are no restrooms inside the cafe, you have to go out, and then take the escalator up to the second floor, which is quite inconvenient.
