A very small spot, with only a couple of counter bar seats that are particularly suitable for working. On a weekend afternoon it was surprisingly not very busy. There was a sign saying "no working remotely" but I asked the staff it was ok to use my laptop and they said it was. Beverage options are very focused on coffee (not plain ice or hot tea offered).
