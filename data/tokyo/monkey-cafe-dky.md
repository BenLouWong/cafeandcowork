Nice vibe, but not very suitable for working. There's a 90 minute time limit at all times. There is WiFi, although it is very slow (basically unusable) and very difficult to connect to. I had to manually assign myself an IP address in the range *192.168.20.xxx* to get it to work. Drinks and snacks available, although quite pricey.
