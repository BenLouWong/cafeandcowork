A fantastic place to work in Jiyugaoka. The cafe is located on the 2nd floor of (tefu). The inside feels very spacious with many different seating areas, and lots of natural light. I particularly like the counter tables by the windows with great views of the train tracks below. A nice selection of drinks, and the pastries looked very tasty (although I didn't try any).

Good WiFi, and some power outlets scattered around. At the counter tables there are power outlets quite hidden under the counter top.
