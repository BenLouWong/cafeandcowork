A bit difficult to get, but definitely worth it, if you are able to hotspot from your phone since there is no WiFi. The nearest station is Gakugeidaigaku, with a 13 minute walk. You can also access by bus from Nakameguro or Meguro station.

First floor has counter style seating. Second floor has tables and some window seats. It was pretty much full on a weekday afternoon, so be sure to arrive early if you want a good seat.
