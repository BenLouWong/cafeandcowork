This spot is located in the basement of Toranomon Hills Station Tower, just next to the Hibiya subway entrance. Lots of seating and you can pretty much always find a seat (lunch time is the most busy time). They have a pretty decent menu with food, drinks, and snacks. The main downside would be that the nearest restrooms are quite far away (inside the T-market shopping/restaurant area).
