I spent a day exploring Kita-Senju and this was my first stop. A large cafe not too far from the station. Very friendly staff. Unfortunately the menu doesn't have any tea. The walnut banana bread was very good. Excellent WiFi, but I didn't really see any power outlets (at least not at the large tables).
