A great spot near Yoyogi where it feels like you're sitting outside thanks to the large open doors. I think it's a popular tourist spot since it's near the North entrance to Meiji-jingu shrine. Nonetheless it's a solid work spot. There are few outlets though, and the wifi wasn't working when I arrived (I asked the staff and I think they rebooted the router, which fixed the problem).
