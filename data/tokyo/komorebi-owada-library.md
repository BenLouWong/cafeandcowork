review:
  en: This public library is one of the Shibuya ward libraries that is closest from the station. Yet, the space is quite limited, you can't take calls unless you go downstairs and book a phone booth for 150 yen per 15 minutes, and you have to sign up (it's just writing your name to a sheet) to use one of the plug seats. They also make you choose how long you plan to use it. It doesn't give you much work vibe to be completely honest.
