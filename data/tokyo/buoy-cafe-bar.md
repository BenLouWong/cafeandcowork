A very interesting spot in Kita-Senju. It's about a 10 minute walk from the station. Apparently this is an old abandoned bowling alley that has been converted to an art space and cafe/bar. I was there on a friday afternoon and it very quiet, just a couple people chatting or working on their laptops.
