Definitely not the fanciest or coziest cafe, but if you're looking for a spot to work from in Shinjuku (even on a weekend) then this seems to be a pretty reliable place. There's very fast wifi and lots of power outlets. The large work table and the counter seats along the windows are nice to sit at.
