review:
  en: This is a modern public library attached with a cafe on the ground floor. There are plenty of seats that you don't have to book (although it was hard to find a vacancy on a Sunday), but also a room with reservable seats and group study desks. The library has a few terrace seats as well. The WiFi is easy to connect and 180Mbps download even with almost 100% capacity. Most of the study desks are meant for quiet work only, but if you take the terrace seat or make use of the phone booth, you could technically take meetings. Though, the phone booth doesn't come with any desks so perhaps it might be bit difficult to have any work related meetings.
