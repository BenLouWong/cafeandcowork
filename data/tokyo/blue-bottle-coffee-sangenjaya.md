A fairly small Blue Bottle coffee shop, but there's quite a lot of seating inside. There are some high tables when you first come in, and there's another large room with regular tables in the back. There's not much sound isolation, so it got very loud when it was busy with people talking. So this is probably best for early mornings or late evenings.
