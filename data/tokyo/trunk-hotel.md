A great place for remote workers in Tokyo. The location is good, right between Shibuya and Omotesando. The lobby space is large, with large worktables, individual tables, and even a large outdoor area, which is nice to use when the weather is good. Fast WiFi and plenty of power outlets. You *can* use the space for free, but you can also orders drinks in the bar (quite pricey though). There's also a small lobby shop selling some cheaper beverages and snacks. Mornings are usually pretty empty, but during the afternoon it fills up quickly!
