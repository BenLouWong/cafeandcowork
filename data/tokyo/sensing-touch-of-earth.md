A cosy café but not great for cowork unfortunately. The WiFi is slow, there are no power outlets and apart from one big table the tables are tiny. It seems quite busy during afternoons and while the space is big most of it is reserved for events and not actually open to café guests. They play some nice background music at a good volume on what looks like a fancy stereo though.
