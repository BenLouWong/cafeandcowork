Espresso House is a chain of coffee shops in Sweden, like a worse version of Starbucks. They have a lot of locations in Stockholm which are all quite similar. This one isn't very comfortable for working but there's several tables with power outlets and high chairs. The more comfortable chairs don't have power. The coffee always tastes a bit burnt and is around $5 for a cappuccino. They have a small selection of sandwiches and pastries.
