Espresso House is a chain of coffee shops in Sweden, like a worse version of Starbucks. They have a lot of locations in Stockholm which are all quite similar, this one is a bit bigger and less crowded than most, especially considering its location on one of the main streets. The coffee always tastes a bit burnt and is about 50 SEK for a cappuccino. They have a small selection of sandwiches and pastries. A nice and quiet place to work in the mornings although the Wi-Fi isn't very good it's easy to grab the seats with power outlets.
