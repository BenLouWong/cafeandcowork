review:
  en: This cafe is located just a minute away from the beach. In fact, if you go upstairs and get a seat with the ocean view! The food is generally good and the milk shake was amazing ðŸ¥¤ They've got some craft beers from town as well. It feels bit more like a restaurant than a work cafe, but when I went, there were a few individuals with laptops open so there are a few who stays there for a long time. Also, the staff said "I wish I can code. Good for you bro", so I guess they don't care if you work there. However, I have to mention that one time I went with a friend, they forgot about our orders and it didn't come out for 40 mins. And they blamed on other staff. That was a bit unprofessional.
