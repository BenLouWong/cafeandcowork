A great cafe to work from in Gastown downtown Vancouver. Perhaps I was just lucky, but when I visited on a weekday morning it was fairly empty, quiet, and comfortable to work from. There's good wifi and some power outlets (although I was the window counter seats had power). The very friendly staff made for a very nice visit. Note that if you need to use the washroom you'll have to ask the staff for the key!
