The Long Hall is a traditional Irish pub with a cozy atmosphere. The interior is dark and wooden, just as you would expect from a traditional pub. There are a few low tables and plenty of bar seating/standing spots although many of them are a bit too narrow for a laptop. It's relatively busy even in hte early afternoon although using a laptop as a solo guest was no problem. There are no power outlets but a relatively speedy Wi-Fi is available. Good selection of beers is of course a plus!
