During mornings this is an ideal place to work. Nice interior, quiet, window seats facing the canal, really a wonderful place to work. There's decent WiFi, and a big menu offering both good food and drinks (brunch/lunch).

On a weekday day time it was fairly empty, just some people working on their laptops. I'm guessing laptops are not allowed during evenings/weekends/busy times though.
