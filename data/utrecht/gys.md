A great restaurant that's also very workable during lunch and early afternoon on weekdays. On weekdays it's usually pretty quiet so it's a nice place to have some good brunch/lunch while getting some work done. The wifi is very fast and there are some power outlets. The WiFi has problems connecting to non-standard ports.
