      h3 我是Philip，我建立網站 👋
      p 遠端工作幾乎是我整個職場生涯的主調，過去幾年我在亞洲各地漫遊，去了日本、越南、韓國、香港等地，最後落腳在台灣。我喜歡在Google Maps上寫評論，也開始編寫我專屬的「適合工作的」地點清單，慢慢的這份清單衍生出這個網站—Cafe and Cowork。
      p 對我來說，一個適合工作的地方需要包含舒適的椅子、安靜的環境、插座、穩定的WiFi，這些是我工作上的基本需求，當然了，如果這個地方有很棒的食物和便宜的飲料那就再好也不過了。
      p 從技術層面來說，這個網站主要是靜態形式(static content),希望讓內容越簡潔越好。我們沒有database，只為每間Cafe編寫自己的markdown/yaml檔案，這個網站利用node.js、express、以及server-side rendering (pug)所架設 (這是我偏好的一種作法)。

      p 歡迎大家來到#[a(href="https://pqvst.com") 我的網站]，來看看我的其他projects，或是到#[a(href="https://github.com/pqvst") GitHub Account]和 #[a(href="https://www.instagram.com/phbergqvist/") IG]來和我聯繫。

      h3 我是Chloe，我寫評論 👋
      p 當我還是譯者的時候，我時常待在咖啡店裡追趕翻譯進度。因為龐大的翻譯量不容許一丁點時間的浪費，我特別在意一家咖啡店離住的地方近不近、有沒有插座以及安靜程度，為了能不踏出店門就能工作滿十多個鐘頭，我也在乎一家店是否供餐。
      p 我時常是店裡最早到、最晚走的客人，累的時候，會倒數剩餘的未翻頁面、偷偷觀察其他客人都在做些什麼，或者翻翻店裡的雜誌和書抽離一下，似乎從那時起，咖啡店對我來說就常和工作連結在一起。我很感激許多店主的包容，也許不曾有過多深的交談，但他們默默地陪伴著我走過一段艱辛的翻譯時光。
      p 隔了很久之後的現在，我們因緣際會開啟了Cafe and Cowork的企劃，想為和我們一樣常常苦惱要去哪裡工作的朋友們提供一個方便的查詢管道。Cafe & Cowork對於Cafe的優劣有一些客觀性的指標，最近的我特別關心一家店的採光、座位設計，並且和以往一樣在乎空間是否吵雜。除了這些直接的評價維度之外，我總是不經意的留意起店主們對一家店投注的一些巧思，即使是外觀不起眼的小店也常充滿著個人風格以及對自由工作者、游牧工作著們的關懷。越來越多店家提供優秀的工作環境，不管是採光、背景音樂、插座、WiFi、桌面、或者是對我來說特別重要的餐點，往往都出奇的傑出，甚至超越許多辦公室。我幾乎可以想像一家店主在規畫著空間時，充滿熱情地勾勒出游牧工作者在這裡工作的場景，並且針對大家的需求一一補強，於是對我來說，比起找到最適合自己工作的地方，發現這些別具用心的Cafe並介紹給大家開始變成了一件重要的事。

      h3 I'm Philip, I build websites 👋

      p I've been working remote for most of my life. During the past couple of years I've spent most of my time traveling around Asia, including Japan, Vietnam, Korea, Hong Kong, and now most recently Taiwan. I've always enjoyed reviewing places on Google Maps, but started maintaining my own collection of "good places to work from" and eventually turned it into this site, Cafe and Cowork.
      
      p For me, the most important factors are comfortable seats, a quiet environment, power outlets, and stable wifi. Those are the main things I need to get work done, but of course it's also nice if there is good food and cheap drinks.
      
      p On the tech-side, this website is mostly static content. To keep things as simple as possible, there is no database, just a markdown/yaml file for each cafe. The website is built with node.js, using express, and pages are rendered server-side using pug (my view engine of choice).

      p You can check out my other projects on #[a(href="https://pqvst.com") my website], or find me online on #[a(href="https://github.com/pqvst") GitHub] and #[a(href="https://www.instagram.com/phbergqvist/") Instagram].

      h3 I'm Chloe, I write reviews 👋 

      p When I was a translator, I often stayed in coffee shops to catch up with my work. There was a lot of work to finish, so no time could be wasted. Because of this my priority was finding a cafe near my place, whether it has power outlets, and how quiet it was. Usually I want to stay as long as possible I also cared about the food so I didn't have to bother myself to go somewhere else.

      p I’m often the first to arrive and the last to leave. When I’m tired, I count down the remaining unturned pages to translate, secretly observed what other people were doing, or flipped through the magazines and books in the store. Since then, cafes were often associated with work to me. I was very grateful for the tolerance of many cafe owners. Maybe they haven't had many interactions with me, but they still accompanied me through a difficult working time.

      p Now, after a long time, we have started the Cafe & Cowork project by coincidence. We want to provide a convenient place for our friends who care about where to work. Cafe & Cowork we try to include as much objective information as possible, both pros and cons. Recently, I am particularly care about natural lighting and the seating arrangement, and I care about whether the space is noisy, just like in the past.
      
      p In addition to these criteria, I always unintentionally pay attention to the thoughtfulness and the effort an owner puts into the cafe. Even small cafes with an inconspicuous appearance are often full of personal style and work towards freelancers and nomads. More and more stores provide excellent working environments. Whether it is lighting, background music, sockets, WiFi, table, or meals that are particularly important to me, they are often surprisingly outstanding, even beyond many offices. I can almost imagine a shop owner enthusiastically sketching out the scene of working here when designing the space, and complementing them one by one according to everyone’s needs. So for me, rather than just finding the best place for myself, it has become more important to find a place where the owner cares.
